Problem:
Write a program (using functions!) that asks the user for a long string containing multiple words.
Print back to the user the same string, except with the words in backwards order. For example, say I type the string:
 My name is Michele
Then I would see the string:
 Michele is name My
shown back to me.

Solution:

def rev_str(x):
  str2 = []
  for a in str1[::-1]:
    str2.append(a)
  return str2  


str1 = raw_input("enter a string").split()
print ' '.join(rev_str(str1))
