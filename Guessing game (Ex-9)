Problem:

Generate a random number between 1 and 9 (including 1 and 9). Ask the user to guess the number, then tell them whether they guessed too low, too high, or exactly right. 
(Hint: remember to use the user input lessons from the very first exercise)

Extras:

Keep the game going until the user types “exit”
Keep track of how many guesses the user has taken, and when the game ends, print this out.

Solution:

import random
count = 0
while (1):
  a = random.randint(1,9)
  print a
  print ("guess a number between 1 to 9 including 1 and 9")
  guess = int(raw_input())
  if guess < a:
    count += 1
    print "guessed number is too low"
    print "type exit to end the game or enter to continue playing"
    user = raw_input().lower()
    if user == 'exit':
      print "your number of guesses is :", + count
      break
  elif guess > a:
    count += 1
    print "guessed number is too high"
    print "type exit to end the game or enter to continue playing"
    user = raw_input().lower()
    if user == 'exit':
      print "your number of guesses is :", + count
      break
  else:
    count += 1
    print "guessed number is exactly right"
    print "type exit to end the game or enter to continue playing"
    user = raw_input().lower()
    if user == 'exit':
      print "your number of guesses is :", + count
      break
