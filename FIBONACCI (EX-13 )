Problem :

Write a program that asks the user how many Fibonacci numbers to generate and then generates them. 
Take this opportunity to think about how you can use functions. 
Make sure to ask the user to enter the number of numbers in the sequence to generate.
(Hint: The Fibonacci seqence is a sequence of numbers where the next number in the sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers in the sequence. 
The sequence looks like this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, â€¦)

Solution:

def fibo():
  count = int(raw_input("enter how many FIBONACCI numbers to generate"))
  i = 1
  if count == 0:
    user_inp = []
  elif count == 1:
    user_inp = [1]
  elif count == 2:
    user_inp = [1,1]
  elif count > 2:
    user_inp = [1,1]
    while i < (count-1):
      user_inp.append(user_inp[i] + user_inp[i-1])
      i += 1
  return user_inp
    
print (fibo())
