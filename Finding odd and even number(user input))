PROBLEM-2
Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user. 
Hint: how does an even / odd number react differently when divided by 2?

Extras:
If the number is a multiple of 4, print out a different message.
Ask the user for two numbers: one number to check (call it num) and one number to divide by (check).
If check divides evenly into num, tell that to the user. If not, print a different appropriate message.

SOLUTION:

num = int(raw_input("enter the number you want to check for even and odd"))
check = int(raw_input("enter the number to divide"))
even =num%2
if even==0:
  print num ,("is even")
  if (num%4==0):
   print num,( "is divisible by 4")
else:
  print num, ( "is odd")
