Problem:

Make a two-player Rock-Paper-Scissors game. (Hint: Ask for player plays (using input), 
compare them, print out a message of congratulations to the winner, and ask if the players want to start a new game)
Rules of the game:
Rock beats scissors
Scissors beats paper
Paper beats rock

Solution:

while (True):
  print "****THIS IS A ROCK, SCISSORS, PAPER GAME****"
  user1 = raw_input("Player 1:enter your choice").lower()
  user2 = raw_input("Player 2:enter your choice").lower()
  
  if user1 == 'rock' and user2 == 'scissors':
    print "Player 1: Wins"
    print "Do you want to play another game: Y/N"
    answer = raw_input().lower()
    if answer == "n":
      print "Thanks for playing"
      break
  elif user1 == 'scissors' and user2 == 'paper':
    print "Player 1: Wins"
    print "Do you want to play another game: Y/N"
    answer = raw_input().lower()
    if answer == "n":
      print "Thanks for playing"
      break
  elif user1 == 'paper' and user2 == 'rock':
    print "Player 1: Wins"
    print "Do you want to play another game: Y/N"
    answer = raw_input().lower()
    if answer == "n":
      print "Thanks for playing"
      break
  elif user1 == 'scissors' and user2 == 'rock':
    print "Player 2: Wins"
    print "Do you want to play another game: Y/N"
    answer = raw_input().lower()
    if answer == "n":
      print "Thanks for playing"
      break
  elif user1 == 'paper' and user2 == 'scissors':
    print "Player 2: Wins"
    print "Do you want to play another game: Y/N"
    answer = raw_input().lower()
    if answer == "n":
      print "Thanks for playing"
      break
  elif user1 == 'rock' and user2 == 'paper':
    print "Player 2: Wins"
    print "Do you want to play another game: Y/N"
    answer = raw_input().lower()
    if answer == "n":
      print "Thanks for playing"
      break
  else:
    print "Its a tie"
    print "Do you want to play another game: Y/N"
    answer = raw_input().lower()
    if answer == "n":
      print "Thanks for playing"
      break
