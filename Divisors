PROBLEM:

Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. 
(If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. 
For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)


SOLUTION:

num = int (raw_input("enter the number"))

list = range(2,num)

for i in list:
  x = num%i
  if x==0:
    print i,("is the divisor of"),num
