Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them 
that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.
Extras:
Add on to the previous program by asking the user for another number and printing out that many copies of the previous message. 
(Hint: order of operations exists in Python)
Print out that many copies of the previous message on separate lines. (Hint: the string "\n is the same as pressing the ENTER button)


SOLUTION:

name =raw_input("enter your name")
age = raw_input("enter your age")
a = raw_input("Enter the number of times you want to repeat your output ")
b = 100
c = int(age) + b
for i in range(1,int(a)):
  print name, ("your age after 100 years will be ="), c 
  

OUTPUT:


enter your name pratyush
enter your age 26
Enter the number of times you want to repeat your output  10
pratyush your age after 100 years will be = 126
pratyush your age after 100 years will be = 126
pratyush your age after 100 years will be = 126
pratyush your age after 100 years will be = 126
pratyush your age after 100 years will be = 126
pratyush your age after 100 years will be = 126
pratyush your age after 100 years will be = 126
pratyush your age after 100 years will be = 126
pratyush your age after 100 years will be = 126
