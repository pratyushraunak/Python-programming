Problem:

Create a program that will play the “cows and bulls” game with the user. The game works like this:
Randomly generate a 4-digit number. Ask the user to guess a 4-digit number. 
For every digit that the user guessed correctly in the correct place, they have a “cow”. 
For every digit the user guessed correctly in the wrong place is a “bull.”
Every time the user makes a guess, tell them how many “cows” and “bulls” they have. 
Once the user guesses the correct number, the game is over. 
Keep track of the number of guesses the user makes throughout the game and tell the user at the end.

Solution:

import random

def usr_inp(attempt,guessed):
  guessed += 1
  for i in range(4):
    #user_val = raw_input("enter the number")
    attempt.append(int(raw_input("enter a number")))
  return attempt
  return guessed  
  
def cow_bull(count1,count2,list1,attempt):
  for i in list1:
    for j in attempt:
      if j == i:
        if list1.index(i) == attempt.index(j):
        #print list1.index(i)
          count1 += 1
        else:
          count2 += 1
  return count1
  return count2
  
if __name__ == '__main__':
  num = random.randint(1000,1100)
  list1 = [int(i) for i in str(num)]
  #print "hi"
  count1 = 0
  count2 = 0
  guessed = 0
  attempt = []
  while(1):
    usr_inp(attempt,guessed)
    #print attempt
    cow_bull(count1,count2,list1,attempt)
    print "you have", +count1 ,"cows" 
    print "you have", +count2 ,"bulls"
    if count1 == 4:
      print "you have guessed the correct number"
      print "you had", +guessed ,"number of guesses"
      break
