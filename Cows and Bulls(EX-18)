Problem:

Create a program that will play the “cows and bulls” game with the user. The game works like this:
Randomly generate a 4-digit number. Ask the user to guess a 4-digit number. 
For every digit that the user guessed correctly in the correct place, they have a “cow”. 
For every digit the user guessed correctly in the wrong place is a “bull.”
Every time the user makes a guess, tell them how many “cows” and “bulls” they have. 
Once the user guesses the correct number, the game is over. 
Keep track of the number of guesses the user makes throughout the game and tell the user at the end.

Solution:

import random
count1 = 0
count2 = 0
guessed = 0

def usr_inp(attempt,guessed):
  #global guessed    
  guessed += 1
  #print m
  for i in range(4):
    #user_val = raw_input("enter the number")
    attempt.append(int(raw_input("enter a number")))
    #print l
  return attempt , guessed  
  
def cow_bull(count1,count2,list1,attempt):
    #global count1
    #global count2
    #print a
    #print b
    #print c
    #print d
    for i in list1:
        #print i
        for j in attempt:
            #print j
            if j == i:
                if list1.index(i) == attempt.index(j):
                    #print list1.index(i)
                    count1 += 1
                    #print a
                else:
                    count2 += 1
    print count1
    print count2
    return count1 , count2 , list1 , attempt
  
if __name__ == '__main__':
      
  while(1):
      
      attempt = []
      num = random.randint(1000,1100)
      list1 = [int(i) for i in str(num)]
      print list1
      usr_inp(attempt,guessed)
      #print attempt
      cow_bull(count1,count2,list1,attempt)
      print "you have", +count1 ,"cows"
      #print count1
      print "you have", +count2 ,"bulls"
      if count1 == 4:
          print "you have guessed the correct number"
          print "you had", +guessed ,"number of guesses"
          break
