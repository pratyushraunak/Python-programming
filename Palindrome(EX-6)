PROBLEM:

Ask the user for a string and print out whether this string is a palindrome or not. 
(A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.)

SOLUTION:

a = str(raw_input("enter the string to check for Palindrome"))
b = a[:]
b = reversed(b)

if list(a) == list(b):
  print "the string is: Palindrome"      
  
else:
  print "The string is not Palindrome"
