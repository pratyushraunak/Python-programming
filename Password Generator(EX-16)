Problem:
Write a password generator in Python. Be creative with how you generate passwords - 
strong passwords have a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. 
The passwords should be random, generating a new password every time the user asks for a new password. 
Include your run-time code in a main method.

Extra:

Ask the user how strong they want their password to be. For weak passwords, pick a word or two from a list.




Solution:
import random
import string

def strng_pas_gen(y):
  list1 = [random.choice(string.letters + string.digits + '!@#$_/-\?.,+*&') for i in range(y)]
  return ''.join(list1) 

def weak_pas_gen(y):
  list2 = [random.choice(string.letters) for i in range(y)]
  return ''.join(list2)
     
  
  
 
y = int(raw_input("enter the size of the password to generate"))
inp = raw_input("you want strong/weak password to generate: S/W ??").lower()
if inp == 's':
  print strng_pas_gen(y)
else:
  print weak_pas_gen(y)
