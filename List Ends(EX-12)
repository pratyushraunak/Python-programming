Problem:

Write a program that takes a list of numbers (for example, a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25])
and makes a new list of only the first and last elements of the given list. 
For practice, write this code inside a function.

Solution:

import random

a = 0
b = 0
def list_func(a,b):
  for x in list1:
    a = x
    b = list1[-1]
    break
  return(a,b);  
  
list1 = random.sample(range(10), 5)
print list1
list2 = [list_func(a,b)]
print list2
