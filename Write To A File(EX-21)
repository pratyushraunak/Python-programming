Problem:
Take the code from anywhere or write your own, and instead of printing the results to a screen, 
write the results to a txt file. In your code, just make up a name for the file you are saving to.

Extras:

Ask the user to specify the name of the output file that will be saved.

Solution:

import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
 
base_url = 'http://www.nytimes.com'
r = requests.get(base_url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(r.text)

 
for story_heading in soup.find_all(class_="story-heading"): 
    if story_heading.a:
        with open('first_file.txt', 'w') as open_me:
          open_me.write(story_heading.a.text.replace("\n", " ").strip())
    else:
        with open('first_file.txt', 'w') as open_me:
          open_me.write(story_heading.contents[0].strip())
